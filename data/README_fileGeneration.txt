This corpus was curated by the efforts of the Visualizing English Print Project (VEP), made possible by a grant 
from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. For its 
source files, the VEP used Folger Digital Texts (http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/) in XML.




The XML source files for this corpus underwent several transformations to prepare their text transcriptions for 
computational processing. The workflow for text extraction was supervised by VEP PI Mike Gleicher 
(gleicher@cs.wisc.edu) in collaboration with Jonathan Hope (jonathan.r.hope@strath.ac.uk). The XML files were processed by several Python scripts to ensure standard character encodings 
and spelling standardization. The python scripts were the collective work of Wei-chen Chen (zarcen@cs.wisc.edu), 
Erin Winter(wintere@cs.wisc.edu), Eric Alexander (ealexand@cs.wisc.edu), and Deidre Stuffer (stuffer@wisc.edu). Files of 
extracted text were batch processed through VARD (v2.5.4) to ensure the files were processed the same as the corpora VEP generates from Text Creation Partnership texts. 
VEP deploys a version of VARD trained by Deidre Stuffer (stuffer@wisc.edu) on an early modern drama corpus 
for Jonathan Hope. These plain text files were then processed through Ubiqu+Ity (v 1.1; dictionary v3.21), a dictionary-based 
text tagger. Ubiqu+Ity serves as a frontend application that utilizes DocuScope dictionaries, which classify linguistic 
patterns into categories of rhetorical effects. DocuScope is the work of David Kaufer and Suguru Ishizaki at the English 
Department of Carnegie Mellon University.
